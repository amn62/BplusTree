Project 1: B+ Tree
Design Document

Test Cases:
1. Insert into empty leaf with no parent:
	Methods tested:
		- LNode::insertKey
		- LNode::addKey
	Desired outcome:
		- one node where keys has one value: 1
2. Fill leaf with no parent:
	Methods tested:
		- LNode::insertKey
		- LNode::addKey (tests whether keys are added in correct location)
	Desired outcome:
		- one node where keys has 6 values: 1,2,3,4,5,6
3. Insert into full leaf with no parent:
	Methods tested:
		- LNode::insertKey
		- LNode::addKey
		- LNode::split
		- INode::insertKey
	Desired outcome:
		- fill one node then add another to force split
		- split first node into two appropriately
		- pass middle value up to new inner node parent
		- set parentâ€™s children to first leaf node and next
4. Insert into full leaf with full parent:
	Methods tested:
		- BPlusTree::insert
		- BPlusTree::find
		- INode::getLocation
		- LNode::insertKey
		- LNode::addKey
		- LNode::split
		- INode::insertKey
		- INode::split
	Desired outcome:
		- fill tree with values (1-24)
		- force multiple leaf node splits until parent is full
		- insert additional value to force parent to split (25)
		- create new parent with two inner node children
